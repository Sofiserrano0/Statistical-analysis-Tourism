Guide to the code

This project contains four documents relating to the implementation of the analysis:
1.Turismoint numero arribos.xlsx
2. Turismoint numero partidas.xls
3.Gasto turismo int.xls
4.Turismo
The first three are the databases from which the code named in the fourth point is fed, this one runs with Google colab and must be accompanied by the three Excel files to work properly. The code will show you the results of statistical tests, and the analysis of these tests is as follows
Context: 
Incoming tourism is when foreigners visit a country where they do not live, while the outgoing one is when domestic tourists travel within their own country. 
International (receptive) tourism has experienced good growth in the last 2 decades, with France, the USA, China, and Mexico as protagonists, which together represent 35.76% of tourism worldwide.
